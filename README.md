summit is a portable and self-contained Linux server management web dashboard that fits in 3MB.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A lot of features (storage, networking, containers, updates, etc.) are missing currently.

## Features
- All of summit is distributed as one small file
- Portability across init systems and libcs (Tested with Debian and Alpine so far)
- Fast page loads
- PAM-based login system
- xterm.js-based terminal
- HTTP/2 & HTTPS

## Building

All of these commands assume you're running as root. summit will likely build & run on other systems, but I have not tested.

The final compiled output is simply `./summit`. By default, summit installs to `/usr/local/bin`. 

### Alpine

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure you have the community repo enabled

```sh
apk add go make linux-pam-dev git openssl minify xz upx \
    && git clone https://github.com/winksplorer/summit \
    && cd summit \
    && make all install
```

### Debian

```sh
apt install golang-go make libpam0g-dev git openssl minify upx-ucl \
    && git clone https://github.com/winksplorer/summit \
    && cd summit \
    && make all install
```

## Code structure

### *.go

The backend server code. It serves the frontend, and provides a simple API using [WebSockets + MessagePack](doc/COMMUNICATION.md). Written in Go.

### frontend

The frontend web UI code. Written in HTML, vanilla CSS, and vanilla JS.
